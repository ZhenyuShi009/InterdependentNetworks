# InterdependentNetworks
This is a Matlab program designed for the production of paper titled Strategy evolution on interdependent networks.


Fig4_1.m:   obtain the critical benefit-to-cost ratio (b/c)^* for symmetric interdependent networks that both layer has 6 nodes. The results are used to Fig. 4a.
